This dataset is related to Toys data. Executive board has asked a sales report about the different locations and products. This report provides some help to executive board to make decisions. 
It provides some informations like total revenue by month, total orders by product category,total profit by product category,total profit by store city and sum of units by product category.
It also includes total revenue by store city, sum of revenue by product name,total revenue by quarter, total profit by store city and sum of stock on hand by product name.
I applied filter by store location. When we click on each store location, the visual changes.
I first cleaned the data and made necessary transformations and then visualized data. I have also created dashboard using this data and pbix file.
Following are some recommendations for the Project Maven Toys:
1.	Since Downtown has the highest sales and attracts the most customers, we should focus on stocking popular items like arts and crafts, which are in high demand in this location.
2.	The Sports and Outdoors category at the airport isn't performing well, so we should consider adjusting the prices and boosting marketing efforts. Additionally, opening more stores in profitable cities like Guadalajara and Monterrey, Mexico, could increase revenue.
3.	Lego Bricks generate the highest revenue across all locations, so we can slightly raise their prices and ensure they are well-stocked in every store. On the other hand, Rubik's Cubes, which have lower profit margins, would benefit from more promotion to increase sales.
4.	Sales in Durango are not performing well, so we need to implement stronger marketing strategies to attract more customers and improve sales in this city.
5.	Residential locations experience the highest sales in the fourth quarter, so offering discounts and loyalty points would help drive even more purchases and foster customer loyalty during this peak period.
